Through text mining, this project examined which ingredients were most frequently used together in Spanish cuisine recipes.

## Files Description
### Preprocessing
Using PyPDF2, the code extracts ingredient data from `recetas.pdf`. After examining the book, it was found that Spanish recipe ingredients are listed on odd pages starting from page 11 up to page 95. The extracted ingredients are stored in `parrafos_ingredientes.txt` for additional analysis.

### NLP Analysis
The `parrafos_ingredientes.txt` file is parsed and segmented into recipe sections. Each recipe's ingredient list is identified using a Matcher to delineate recipe boundaries. A predefined list of common Spanish ingredients is labeled as "INGREDIENTES" using a PhraseMatcher. A custom spaCy component integrates this matcher to detect ingredient entities throughout the text. Co-occurrence relationships between ingredients within each recipe are then analyzed and stored in a dictionary structure.

### Graph representation
Using the networkx library, the relationships between ingredients were represented as graphs. Various centrality measurements, such as closeness and betweenness, were applied to analyze these relationships. This analysis provided insights into the most central ingredients and their importance in Spanish cuisine recipes. Finally, the Louvain community detection algorithm classified the ingredients into communities based on their positions in the graph.
